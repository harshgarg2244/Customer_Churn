# Customer Churn Data Analytics

## 📌 Project Overview
Customer churn is a major challenge for subscription-based businesses.  
This project analyzes a real-world telecom customer dataset to identify the key factors that influence customer churn using Python and data analytics techniques.

The goal of this project is to convert raw customer data into meaningful business insights that can help improve customer retention.

## 📂 Dataset
- **Source:** Kaggle – Telco Customer Churn Dataset  
- **File Name:** `WA_Fn-UseC_-Telco-Customer-Churn.csv`  
- **Description:**  
  The dataset contains customer demographic details, services used, contract information, billing data, and churn status.

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- Python  
- Pandas  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn  
- Google Colab  

## 🔍 Key Analysis Performed
- Data cleaning and preprocessing  
- Handling missing and inconsistent values  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Churn distribution analysis  
- Relationship between churn and:
  - Contract type  
  - Monthly charges  
  - Customer tenure  
  - Internet service  

## 📊 Key Insights
- Customers with **month-to-month contracts** have the highest churn rate  
- **Higher monthly charges** increase the likelihood of churn
